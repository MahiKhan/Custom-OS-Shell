Custom-OS-Shell
===============

Created as part of 3rd Year Operating Systems Module at University College London (UCL) 

Requires .profile file to be in the same directory as os.c file (the shell) to be run. 

Code fairly straightforward elsewise and comments have been provided to help follow code.  

Allows 
1) Running terminal commands and programs found within the environment variables PATH (e.g. ls, pwd, mkdir, gcc)
2) Using the command cd (customly coded into shell) to go in and out files 
3) Allows PATH and HOME environment variables to be changed from the terminal
